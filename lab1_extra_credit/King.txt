1  Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern! 
3  The need we have to use you did provoke 
13 That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court 
10 I cannot dream of: I entreat you both 
18 That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
15 To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather, 
17 Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus, 
9  So much from the understanding of himself, 
14 Some little time: so by your companies 
4  Our hasty sending. Something have you heard 
8  More than his father's death, that thus hath put him 
2  Moreover that we much did long to see you, 
5  Of Hamlet's transformation; so I call it, 
16 So much as from occasion you may glean, 
11 That, being of so young days brought up with him, 
6  Since nor the exterior nor the inward man 
12 And since so neighbour'd to his youth and humour, 
7  Resembles that it was. What it should be, 
35 Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
