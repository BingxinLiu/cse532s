19 Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you, 
21 To whom he more adheres. If it will please you 
23 As to expend your time with us awhile, 
22 To show us so much gentry and good-will 
25 Your visitation shall receive such thanks 
26 As fits a king's remembrance.
20 And sure I am two men there are not living 
24 For the supply and profit of our hope, 
36 Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz: 
38 My too-much-changed son.--Go, some of you, 
37 And I beseech you instantly to visit 
39 And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
42 Ay, amen!
